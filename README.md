This project implements the Tower of Hanoi puzzle in Java. The Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, involving moving a set of disks from one rod to another, following specific rules.

### Improved performance "mode"
To improve performance, you can change the performanceMode variable in the Main class. This mode will not print each move of the solution, it will instead provide updates at regular intervals about the progress of the solution.
